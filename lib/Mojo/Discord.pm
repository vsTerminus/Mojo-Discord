=head1 NAME

Mojo::Discord - An implementation of the Discord Public API using Mojo

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojo::Discord> is a L<Mojo::UserAgent> based L<Discord|https://discord.com> API library designed for creating bots (including user-bots). A Discord User or Bot Token is required.

The Discord API is divided into four main parts: OAuth, REST, Gateway, and Guild. The main module is a wrapper that allows you to use the REST and Gateway modules together as part of a single object.

All REST methods can be called with an optional trailing callback argument to run a non-blocking API Query.

Note: This module implements only a subset of the available API calls. Additional features will be added as needed for my other projects, or possibly by request. You may also contribute via github pull request.

=head1 PROPERTIES

L<Mojo::Discord> requires the following to be passed in on instantiation

=head2 token
    This is a Discord Bot token generated by the Discord API. 

=head2 name
    This is the Library Name that Discord wants in your useragent and gateway IDENT packet. It defaults to 'Mojo::Discord'. You should not change this unless you are forking the repository.

=head2 url
    A URL relevant to your bot - perhaps a github repo or a public website.

=head2 version
    The version of your client application

=head2 reconnect
    A boolean value (1 or 0) telling the library whether or not it should try to automatically reconnect if it gets disconnected.

=head2 loglevel
    Minimum event priority to log to disk. Options are FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, and DEBUG

=head2 logdir
    A directory you have access to write to, where the library can write logs to disk. Do not include a trailing slash.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<Mojo::Discord> provides these attributes of its submodules, which for the most part you shouldn't need to interact with directly, but you can if you want to.

=head2 gw
    This is the Mojo::Discord::Gateway object. Currently you should only call this directly when subscribing to EventEmitter events.

    The Gateway is a mostly-one-way communication websocket which sends your client JSON payloads whenever an event happens (eg user sends a message or you join a new guild)

    Certain messages (eg Heartbeat) do go out via the Gateway websocket, but the majority of actions your client will take are done via the REST API.

=head2 rest
    This is the Mojo::Discord::REST object. It is responsible for things like sending messages to channels, getting user info, and most other actions any client would take.

    All of the functions it provides accept an optional callback, and will return their results to said callback if provided.

=head2 guilds
    This is the Mojo::Discord::Guild object, which stores information about the guilds your client is currently a member of

    There isn't much functionality here yet, it is just intended to store the info it receives from the Discord Gateway so it can be accessed without needing REST calls.

=head2 log
    The library's Mojo::Log object, in case you wanted to log something to the library's log file

=head2 logdir
    The directory you would like to write logs to

=head2 loglevel
    How much information do you want? Default is 'debug', but recommendations might be 'info' or 'warn', or for even less, 'fatal'.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

L<Mojo::Discord> provides the following subs you may want to leverage

=head2 init()
    Writes a "New session beginning" message to the log and starts the connection to Discord's Gateway. You should call this and then start Mojo::IOLoop when you're ready to start your bot.

=head2 connected()
    Performs some validation to see if the Gateway is still connected and valid. Returns boolean.

=head2 resume()
    Same idea as init(), but tries to resume the previous session if the bot got disconnected. This is used automatically if you enable the 'reconnect' attribute.

=head2 disconnect()
    Manually finish the Gateway connection

=head2 create_dm
    This creates a Direct Message (DM) "channel". Takes a recipient ID (user id) and returns the new DM channel ID via callback.

=head2 send_dm
    This calls create_dm and then sends a message to the resulting channel, saving you a step.
    Takes a user ID, a message to send, and an optional callback.

=head2 send_ack_dm
    This works like send_dm, but it also leaves a :white_check_mark: emoji reaction on a message to acknowledge it first. Great for lengthy command responses you want to send via PM, but want to let people know the bot did respond.
    Takes a channel ID and message ID to react to, a user ID to send the DM to, and a message to send. Also takes an optional callback.

=head2 add_user
    Cache user info. Discord doesn't explicitely send us user info, it just arrives with other events. If we track it we can use it later without needing to look it up first.

=head2 get_user
    If we have a user object cached for this ID, it returns it. If not, then it calls get_user from the REST API.
    Takes a user id and an optional callback.

=head2 get_guilds
    Takes a user ID and an optional callback. Returns the list of guilds a user is part of. Requires the guilds OAuth2 scope.
    Takes a user id, returns a list of partial guild objects via callback

=head2 start_typing
    Takes a channel ID and an optional callback
    Makes it look like the bot is typing. Typically bots respond too quickly for this, but if you have a long-running command and want your users to know the bot is "workig on it", this might be a solution.

=head2 create_webhook
    Takes a channel and a hashref with the webhook structure parameters (See Discord API) and tries to create a webhook in the current channel.
    Webhooks allow the bot to use additional formatting options, including custom avatars, stylized links, and embedded images in their messages.
    Result is returned via optional callback.

=head2 send_webhook
    Works like sending a message, but allows you to use all the additional webhook formatting options.
    This will fail if you don't have a webhook created for the current channel already.
    Takes a channel ID, a webhook ID, and a webhook payload hashref (See Discord API docs), and an optional callback.

=head2 get_channel_webhooks
    Takes a channel ID, returns a list of webhooks in this channel via callback sub

=head2 get_guild_webhooks
    Takes a guild ID and returns a list of webhooks for all channels in the guild via callback

=head2 create_reaction
    Takes a channel ID, a message ID, an Emoji (either Unicode or in the custom emoji format) and an optional callback
    Adds the emoji to the message as a reaction
