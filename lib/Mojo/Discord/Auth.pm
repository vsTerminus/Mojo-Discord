########################
# This module handles some of the OAuth2 stuff for Discord
# 
# For now it really doesn't do much other than take an Auth Code and request a Token.
# You also have to pass in the usual name/url/version for the application's UserAgent string,
# and for this module it also requires the Application's ID and Secret, as well as the Auth Callback URL
